# Google Spreadsheet Analysis - Ashby BART Project

## Spreadsheet Structure

Based on the browser access, the spreadsheet contains the following tabs:

1. **0 Pro Forma** (gid=1321959354) - Main financial model
2. **0 Ground lease** - Ground lease terms and calculations
3. **0 Data** - Base data and assumptions
4. **0 Commercial Comp** - Commercial comparable properties
5. **0 Housing Comp** - Housing comparable properties  
6. **Data cleanup** - Data processing/cleaning tab

## Analysis Approach

To properly analyze the spreadsheet data, I need access to:

### Critical Data Points to Validate:

#### 1. Pro Forma Tab
- **Construction Costs**: $/SF, $/unit, total project cost
- **Revenue Assumptions**: Rent/SF, unit mix, absorption timeline
- **Operating Expenses**: Per unit, per SF, as % of revenue
- **Financing**: Debt terms, equity structure, interest rates
- **Returns**: IRR, equity multiple, cash-on-cash
- **Timeline**: Development phases, lease-up assumptions

#### 2. Ground Lease Tab
- **Land Cost Structure**: Ground lease rate, purchase price, or revenue share
- **BART Terms**: Specific lease terms, duration, escalations
- **Land Value**: Market value vs. negotiated value
- **Impact on Economics**: How land cost affects project returns

#### 3. Data Tab
- **Unit Mix**: Breakdown by unit type (studio, 1BR, 2BR, 3BR)
- **Average Unit Size**: SF per unit type
- **Rent Assumptions**: Market rents by unit type
- **Vacancy Assumptions**: Stabilized vs. lease-up
- **Operating Expense Assumptions**: Per unit, per SF

#### 4. Commercial Comp Tab
- **Comparable Properties**: Similar to housing comps but for retail/commercial
- **Rent/SF**: Commercial rent rates
- **Vacancy**: Commercial vacancy assumptions
- **Tenant Mix**: Types of commercial tenants

#### 5. Housing Comp Tab
- **Comparable Properties**: Should match our existing comp analysis
- **Price/Unit**: Sale prices per unit
- **Price/SF**: Sale prices per square foot
- **Rent/SF**: Actual rent data (if available)
- **Vacancy Rates**: Current vacancy
- **Year Built**: Age of properties
- **Location**: Addresses and proximity to transit

## Key Questions to Answer

### 1. **Cost Validation**
- Do construction costs align with Bay Area market ($400-600/SF)?
- Is total project cost realistic for 750-1,200 units?
- Are soft costs (20-30% of hard costs) included?

### 2. **Revenue Validation**
- Are rent assumptions ($4.88/SF/month) validated by comps?
- Is unit mix appropriate for market demand?
- Are absorption assumptions realistic (20-40 units/month)?

### 3. **Land Cost Clarity**
- What are the specific BART ground lease terms?
- How does land cost compare to market rates?
- What's the impact on project economics?

### 4. **Capital Structure**
- Is equity/debt split realistic (30-40% equity, 60-70% debt)?
- Are interest rates and loan terms reasonable?
- Are grants/incentives quantified?

### 5. **Returns Analysis**
- Are projected returns realistic for this risk profile?
- How do returns compare to comps?
- What are the key value drivers?

### 6. **Timeline Validation**
- Is development timeline realistic (6-9 years)?
- Are lease-up assumptions conservative?
- Are there contingencies for delays?

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Export each tab as CSV** and share the files
2. **Or copy/paste key sections** from each tab
3. **Or share screenshots** of critical sections

Once I have the data, I can:
- ✅ Validate all assumptions against market data
- ✅ Check for calculation errors
- ✅ Identify gaps or inconsistencies
- ✅ Compare to our existing comp analysis
- ✅ Provide recommendations for improvements
- ✅ Assess overall feasibility

## Initial Observations (from what I can see)

The spreadsheet structure appears comprehensive with:
- ✅ Separate tabs for different components (good organization)
- ✅ Pro forma model (essential for feasibility)
- ✅ Comparable properties (validates assumptions)
- ✅ Ground lease analysis (addresses land cost gap)

**However, I need to see the actual data values to provide meaningful analysis.**
