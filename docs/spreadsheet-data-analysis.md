# Comprehensive Spreadsheet Data Analysis - Ashby BART Project

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment**: The spreadsheet data is **well-researched and generally realistic**, but there are **several critical issues** that need to be addressed before building the pro forma. The data shows good market research, but some assumptions are inconsistent or need validation.

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

### 1. **Ground Lease Analysis** - Strong
- **99-year lease term**: Appropriate for BART (they only lease 65-99 years)
- **$200/SF land value**: Reasonable for Berkeley near BART ($150-220/SF range)
- **50% BMR discount**: Consistent with BART policy (35-50% typical)
- **5.5% ground rent yield**: Standard for public agency leases (5-6%)
- **Land comps**: Good local comparables (2902-2908 Adeline, 2903 Adeline)

### 2. **Housing Comps** - Excellent Research
- **Strong local comps**: Maudelle Miller Shirek, Harper Crossing, Parker, 26FIFTY
- **Good mix**: Affordable and market-rate comparables
- **Detailed unit-level data**: Rent/SF analysis is thorough
- **Distance to BART**: Properly documented

### 3. **Commercial Comps** - Good Coverage
- **Retail range**: $18-50/SF/YR (appropriate for Berkeley)
- **Office range**: $30-55/SF/YR (realistic for Berkeley submarkets)
- **Local properties**: Good use of Adeline corridor properties

### 4. **Rent Assumptions** - Generally Validated
- **Market 1BR**: $2,750 ($4.00-5.50/SF) - ✅ Supported by 26FIFTY ($2,895-3,395)
- **Market 2BR**: $3,500 ($4.00-6.00/SF) - ✅ Supported by Parker ($4,200-6,500)
- **Affordable rents**: Properly tied to AMI bands

## ⚠️ Critical Issues & Inconsistencies

### 1. **MAJOR: Unit Count Mismatch** 🔴

**The Problem:**
- **Essay says**: 750-1,200 units
- **Spreadsheet says**: **144 units** (due to 70-foot height limit)

**Impact:**
- This is a **massive reduction** (80-88% smaller)
- Changes entire project economics
- Need to reconcile this discrepancy

**Questions:**
- Is 70-foot height limit correct?
- Can you get height variance/exception?
- Is 144 units the actual feasible count?
- If so, essay needs major revision

**Recommendation**: 
- **Clarify actual unit count** before building pro forma
- If 144 units is correct, revise project scope throughout
- If 750-1,200 units is goal, need to address height restrictions

### 2. **Square Footage Doesn't Add Up** 🔴

**The Problem:**
- Site Area: 191,664 SF (4.4 acres) ✅
- Retail: 58,000 SF
- Office: 76,000 SF  
- Residential: 138,000 SF
- **Total: 272,000 SF** (but site is only 191,664 SF)

**This is impossible!** You can't build more SF than the site area (unless going vertical, but even then...)

**Reality Check:**
- If 70-foot height limit = ~6-7 stories
- 191,664 SF site × 6 stories = ~1.15M SF max (theoretical)
- But your breakdown shows only 272,000 SF, which should fit
- **Wait - are these NET SF or GROSS SF?**

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify if SF are net rentable or gross building
- Add parking SF (if structured parking)
- Add common areas, corridors, mechanical
- Show building efficiency ratio

### 3. **Residential SF Per Unit Seems Low** ⚠️

**The Problem:**
- 144 units ÷ 138,000 SF residential = **958 SF per unit average**
- But your unit mix shows:
  - 1BR: 600-700 SF (84 units × 650 SF avg = 54,600 SF)
  - 2BR: 850-1,000 SF (42 units × 925 SF avg = 38,850 SF)
  - 3BR: 1,050-1,200 SF (18 units × 1,125 SF avg = 20,250 SF)
  - **Total: 113,700 SF** (not 138,000 SF)

**Gap**: Missing ~24,300 SF (could be common areas, but need to clarify)

**Recommendation**:
- Break down residential SF: unit SF vs. common areas
- Show building efficiency (typically 75-85% for residential)

### 4. **Construction Cost Validation** ⚠️

**The Numbers:**
- Hard Costs: $111,520,000
- Total Residential + Retail + Office: 272,000 SF
- **Cost per SF: $410/SF** ✅ (within $400-450/SF range)

**However:**
- This assumes all SF are built at same cost
- Retail/office typically cost less than residential
- Need to break down costs by use type

**Recommendation**:
- Separate hard costs:
  - Residential: $400-450/SF
  - Retail shell: $350-400/SF
  - Office shell: $350-400/SF
  - Parking: $15-20K per stall

### 5. **Ground Rent Calculation Issue** 🔴

**The Problem:**
- Base Ground Rent After Completion: **$1,054,152/year**
- Calculation: $200/SF × 191,664 SF × 50% discount × 5.5% yield = **$1,054,152** ✅
- **BUT**: This is for the FULL site value
- If you're only using part of the site, or if BART keeps some land, this needs adjustment

**Also:**
- Development phase rent: $50,000/year (reasonable)
- But jumps to $1,054,152 after completion (21x increase)
- **Is this correct?** Or should it phase in?

**Recommendation**:
- Clarify if ground rent applies to entire 4.4 acres
- Or just the developed portion
- Consider phased rent increases during lease-up

### 6. **Financing Structure Needs Detail** ⚠️

**Current:**
- Debt: 65% ($94.2M)
- Equity: 35% ($50.7M)
- **Total: $144.9M** ✅ (matches total development cost)

**Missing:**
- **LIHTC Equity**: $11M (is this part of the $50.7M equity, or additional?)
- **Tax-Exempt Bonds**: $9M (is this part of debt, or separate?)
- **Soft/Public Loans**: $5M (is this part of equity, or separate?)

**Need to clarify capital stack:**
- Total Sources = Total Uses ($144.9M)
- Break down: Conventional debt + LIHTC equity + bonds + public loans + sponsor equity

### 7. **Operating Expense Assumption** ⚠️

**Current:**
- Operating Expenses: **35% of gross income**

**Reality Check:**
- This is reasonable for mixed-use (30-35% typical)
- **BUT**: Need to break down by use type:
  - Residential: 30-35% of gross rent
  - Retail: 40-50% (higher due to CAM, TI, vacancies)
  - Office: 35-45% (similar to retail)

**Recommendation**:
- Calculate operating expenses separately for each use
- Don't use blanket 35% for all

### 8. **Vacancy Assumptions** - Generally Good ✅

- Residential: 5% ✅ (conservative, appropriate)
- Office: 12% ✅ (realistic for Berkeley, matches market data)
- Retail: 10% ✅ (reasonable for neighborhood retail)

### 9. **Lease-Up Timeline** - Generally Reasonable ✅

- Residential: 12 months ✅ (20-40 units/month = 3.6-7.2 months for 144 units, so 12 months is conservative)
- Office: 24 months ✅ (realistic given 12% vacancy market)
- Retail: 18 months ✅ (TI and permitting delays)

**However:**
- If you're doing 144 units, lease-up should be faster (maybe 8-10 months)
- 12 months is conservative, which is good

### 10. **Rent Assumptions vs. Comps** - Good Alignment ✅

**Market 1BR:**
- Spreadsheet: $2,750/month ($4.00-5.50/SF)
- 26FIFTY comp: $2,895-3,395 ($5.12-5.64/SF) ✅
- **Your assumption is conservative** (good)

**Market 2BR:**
- Spreadsheet: $3,500/month ($4.00-6.00/SF)
- Parker comp: $4,200-6,500 ($4.00-5.42/SF) ✅
- **Your assumption is conservative** (good)

**Affordable Rents:**
- Properly tied to AMI bands ✅
- Supported by Harper Crossing, Ashby Apartments comps ✅
