Project Overview (Kiyan)
Site Description and Physical Conditions(Kiyan)
The Ashby BART Station site encompasses approximately 4.4 acres across an irregular triangular block bounded by Martin Luther King Jr. Way to the west and Adeline Street to the east. The parcel is currently improved with a surface parking lot associated with the station and contains no existing structures of material consequence. Topography is favorable for development, with a low and uniform gradient that slopes gently across the site. The ground plane is predominantly paved, and no significant natural features, drainage barriers, or geotechnical impediments are evident from its long-term use as a transportation facility. However, coordination with BART regarding subsurface structures, vibration considerations, and station access will be required.
The parcel’s shape creates a broad southern frontage and a narrowing northern edge, conditions that will influence building orientation, circulation, and open-space placement. Access is well established along both major arterials, with existing curb cuts, sidewalks, and bicycle infrastructure. Utilities and transportation connections are already in place, limiting the need for off-site extensions. The overall physical condition of the land is consistent with long-term infrastructure use and supports efficient preparation for mixed-use development.


Neighborhood and Planning Context(Kiyan)
The Ashby BART Station is situated in a well-established South Berkeley neighborhood defined by a mix of single-family homes, small apartment buildings, local retail, and community-serving institutions. Adeline Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way form active commercial corridors with restaurants, neighborhood shops, and daily-needs services. The area is walkable and bike-friendly, and the station functions as a major multimodal hub with direct BART service to Oakland, San Francisco, and the East Bay, along with frequent AC Transit routes. UC Berkeley lies approximately one mile to the north and is easily accessible via bus, bicycle, or a direct connection along Martin Luther King Jr. Way. South Berkeley already serves as a major residential area for graduate students, researchers, and university staff, reinforcing strong demand for housing and nearby amenities.
From a planning standpoint, the surroundings reflect the City of Berkeley’s longstanding emphasis on transit-oriented growth, infill housing, and strengthened commercial districts near BART stations. The Lorin District, Berkeley Bowl, and long-standing arts, food, and cultural venues contribute to steady foot traffic and neighborhood activity throughout the week. The area’s existing infrastructure, established street grid, and proximity to major educational and employment centers create a supportive environment for mixed-use, higher-density development that complements the surrounding residential fabric while activating the station area.
Zoning and Regulatory Framework(Kiyan)
The project site lies within the R-BMU zoning district, which supports higher-density residential development with active ground-floor uses in locations served by major transit. This designation permits mixed-use buildings, increased height, and greater residential intensity compared to traditional residential zones, reflecting the city’s intent to concentrate growth along corridors such as Adeline Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The zoning framework also encourages pedestrian-oriented design, reduced parking demand, and integration of neighborhood-serving commercial uses. In addition to city zoning, BART’s regional transit-oriented development guidelines promote higher-density housing, reduced automobile dependence, and active ground-floor uses on station-adjacent land, making the site well aligned with both local and regional TOD policy.
Berkeley’s planning policies strongly favor dense, mixed-use development near transit, particularly around BART stations, where the General Plan calls for additional housing capacity, walkable services, and reduced dependence on cars. Proximity to UC Berkeley further reinforces the city’s objective to accommodate housing demand in well-connected locations. At the state level, California has adopted a clear mandate for transit-oriented growth through legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, expanding the housing supply, and encouraging infill near high-frequency transit. These combined policy drivers create a supportive regulatory environment for a vertically integrated, mixed-use project that increases housing density and activates the station area.
Highest and Best Use Assessment(Kiyan)
The Ashby BART Station site satisfies legal permissibility under the R-BMU district, which allows higher-density residential and mixed-use development in transit-served locations. The zoning framework supports multifamily housing, active ground-floor uses, and reduced parking requirements, all aligned with Berkeley’s and California’s broader transit-oriented housing objectives. As the land is jointly controlled by BART for station operations, the project will also proceed under BART’s established joint-development and TOD guidelines, which further reinforce the feasibility of a higher-density program.
The site meets physical possibility due to its 4.4-acre size, regular access from two major arterials, gentle topography, and existing utility infrastructure. Its current use as surface parking indicates minimal demolition needs and no evident environmental or geotechnical barriers. The parcel’s shape and frontage support efficient massing and circulation, enabling a range of development configurations that align with TOD goals.
From a financial feasibility standpoint, multifamily housing represents the strongest and most reliable revenue driver given the site’s position directly on a BART line, proximity to UC Berkeley, and adjacency to established residential neighborhoods. Transit accessibility supports consistent demand and lower vacancy risk, while ground-floor commercial space remains viable at a neighborhood-serving scale. The site’s scale allows cost-efficient construction and competitive absorption.
In terms of maximum productivity, a higher-density mixed-use residential program produces the greatest long-term value. It captures sustained housing demand, leverages the site’s transit orientation, and aligns with city, regional, and state policy incentives. Lower-density or single-use alternatives would underutilize the land and generate weaker financial and community outcomes.

Land Acquisition and Entitlement Strategy (Andrew)
The land acquisition and entitlement approach for the Ashby BART development is structured to align with the long-term vision of the site, minimise acquisition/holding risk, and maximise upside from transit-oriented-development incentives. The 4.4-acre parcel controlled by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) currently serves as surface parking, which simplifies conversion to a mixed-use format and significantly lowers demolition risk. Because the property is already owned or controlled by BART, acquisition is more about negotiated long-term ground-lease or joint‐development terms rather than third-party purchase, thereby enhancing timing certainty and reducing land cost escalation risk.
From an entitlement perspective, the site lies in the R-BMU zoning district under the City of Berkeley General Plan, which expressly supports higher-density residential and mixed‐use development in transit-adjacent locations. This zoning alignment substantially reduces land-use risk. The project team will engage with BART’s development guidelines, city planning staff, and key stakeholders early to synchronise timeline, scope, and community engagement. Key steps include: securing initial development agreement with BART; confirming any required station access or sub-surface coordination; initiating pre-application meetings with Berkeley Planning & Development to flag significant community issues; preparing a robust environmental review (likely a CEQA Addendum or MND given site history and prior use); and submitting design review and building permit applications aligned with TOD design guidelines (reduced parking, pedestrian/bike access, ground-floor activation).
To enhance control and flexibility, the acquisition structure contemplates a staged approach: an initial option or lease agreement anchored to entitlement milestones (e.g., zoning confirmation, community benefit agreement approval, schematic design), followed by full execution of the ground lease and construction financing. This phasing mitigates the risk of cost escalation in entitlement or design, and supports investor confidence ahead of final financing. On the financial side, the structure leans on BART’s willingness to partner via joint‐development revenue-sharing (versus full market land price), and the ability to layer mission-aligned grant funding or below-market ground-lease terms given the public transit goals. Combined, this strategy positions the project to proceed with high timing certainty, manageable land cost, and strong alignment with city and regional TOD policy.
Market Analysis (Andrew) 
The Ashby BART site sits at the heart of South Berkeley, a neighbourhood characterised by walkability, strong transit connectivity (direct BART service to Oakland and San Francisco), and proximity to University of California, Berkeley (approximately one mile away). These attributes anchor the area’s appeal to several demand cohorts: graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, faculty and university staff, early-career professionals in adjacent innovation clusters (including AI, biotech, and research) and commuters working in downtown San Francisco or Oakland who prioritise transit access and quality of life. Increasingly, as companies require hybrid in-office work patterns, locations near major transit nodes such as Ashby will become more desirable for residents seeking both flexibility and connectivity.
Rental market data for the Berkeley and East Bay region indicate that a meaningful share of units now lease at more than $3,000/month, and listings near Ashby station show two-bedrooms in the range of around $3,900/month (for ~800 sq ft) in nearby buildings. Local market data indicate downward pressure on legacy units, which reinforces our strategy to deliver a high-quality, transit-adjacent residential program at the Ashby BART site that can command premium rents and outperform the older stock. Vacancy remains tight in transit‐adjacent zones, and new supply is limited by land-use constraints and escalating construction costs. According to the City of Berkeley’s February 2025 Economic Dashboard, business occupancy data indicate that the retail/commercial base in the South Berkeley / Adeline corridor remains active, supporting the project’s ground-floor retail strategy. While the residential component of the project enjoys strong fundamentals, the adjacent office market exhibits elevated vacancy, and direct vacancy in the East Bay office market reached 13.5% in 2025Q3, underscoring the importance of designing for flexibility and capturing evolving demand.
These dynamics create a favourable environment for rental growth and stable lease-up assumptions in the coming years. Given the favourable demand-supply characteristics, the proposed Ashby BART project is well positioned to deliver competitive market rents while offering modern amenities and strong transit access. Amenity positioning should emphasise bike-friendly and transit-rich features, commuter-friendly storage, coworking or flexible workspace (to tap hybrid work patterns), and ground-floor retail that complements resident and BART rider foot traffic.
On the retail/commercial side, the focus should be on local-serving uses with steady trade (such as cafés, boutique fitness studios, and convenience grocers) rather than destination retail, thereby reducing tenant risk and aligning with neighbourhood‐based demand. Given the site’s transit node status and 60%+ in-office employment potential in nearby employment zones, the building’s connectivity should drive both rental demand and retail patronage.
The main risks to the market assumptions are a macroeconomic downturn affecting job growth in the Bay Area, increased supply of comparable multifamily products near BART, and elevated construction/operating cost inflation. The positive fundamentals and the site’s strategic location provide a buffer to these risks, but they should still be reflected in conservative underwriting
Economic and Financial Feasibility (Andrew)
The economic and financial feasibility of the Ashby BART development is strengthened by several converging macroeconomic, regional, and site-specific factors that together support a stable, long-duration investment thesis. Berkeley continues to exhibit durable housing demand driven by constrained supply, strong amenity access, and proximity to UC Berkeley, downtown Oakland, and the broader Bay Area technology economy. Despite periodic market volatility, rents in Berkeley and the inner East Bay have demonstrated long-term resilience, with consistent year-over-year growth driven by persistent undersupply and extremely low vacancy around transit-rich locations. New housing near BART stations has historically achieved faster absorption, stronger retention, and rent premiums attributable to mobility advantages and access to employment centers. As hybrid workplace norms evolve, employers across the Bay Area are increasingly adopting structured in-office policies. Berkeley lies at the center of this emerging geography: it offers direct, congestion-free rail access to San Francisco and Oakland job clusters while remaining closely tied to the surging AI and research ecosystems forming around UC Berkeley.
Against this backdrop, the Ashby BART project’s revenue profile is anchored by rental housing, a use that has exhibited the highest stability and clearest price trajectory in South Berkeley. Transit-oriented residential projects in comparable locations have achieved strong lease-up velocity and stable rent growth, even in soft macro periods, due to the enduring appeal of walkable, amenity-rich, academically adjacent neighborhoods. The project further benefits from the site’s unique 4.4-acre scale, which supports operational efficiencies, modern building systems, and an optimized mix of unit types designed to attract a broad renter base including graduate students, faculty, early-career professionals in the AI and life-science sectors, and long-term Berkeley residents seeking high-quality housing near familiar community assets. Ground-floor commercial uses contribute modest but dependable incremental income, focused on neighborhood-serving tenants with consistent foot traffic. Conservative pro forma assumptions (market rents indexed to current South Berkeley comparables, realistic vacancy allowances, and escalating operating expenses) indicate that the building can reach stabilized operations at competitive margins.
On the cost side, the site avoids major demolition, environmental remediation, or off-site infrastructure expansion, reducing risk relative to typical infill redevelopment. Construction costs remain elevated across the Bay Area but can be mitigated through phasing, competitive contracting, and a program that emphasizes efficient massing and modularity. When factoring in the availability of state-level transit-oriented development incentives, potential local and regional funding programs, and mission-aligned capital interested in Berkeley’s long-term economic fabric, the project’s feasibility improves further. Taken together, the Ashby BART development demonstrates strong financial viability based on proven local demand, favorable macro trends, and financial structures that effectively support a large-scale, mixed-use program in a prime transit location.
Capital Structure (Andrew)
The capital structure for the Ashby BART development is designed to balance financial performance, risk mitigation, and long-term community alignment while leveraging the substantial public, quasi-public, and mission-driven capital available for transit-oriented, workforce-oriented, and sustainability-focused projects in California. Total project capitalization will be met through a combination of senior debt, sponsor equity, and strategically sourced gap funding from grants, public incentives, and value-aligned limited partners investing with an explicit interest in Berkeley’s economic and cultural future.
Senior construction debt will form the core of the structure, targeting a competitive loan-to-cost ratio consistent with mixed-use multifamily projects in stable, transit-rich markets. Permanent financing options from agency lenders, mission-driven banks, or green financing programs tied to energy-efficient building systems provide long-term stability and predictable debt service. Sponsor equity will be structured to support early-stage predevelopment, entitlement, and design-phase expenditures, with commitments scaled as key approvals are secured. Given the project’s alignment with California’s housing, transportation, and climate mandates, several layers of non-dilutive or partially dilutive funding may supplement the conventional structure. These include state transit-oriented development grants, regional planning support, potential tax-credit layers for sustainability components, and BART-affiliated or city-affiliated funding mechanisms designed to catalyze station-area development.
A distinctive feature of the expected capital stack is the opportunity to engage strategic limited partners with explicit interest in Berkeley’s growth trajectory. Philanthropic foundations, university-affiliated investment arms, anchor institutions, and impact-oriented real estate funds have demonstrated increasing appetite for projects that reinforce housing affordability, academic workforce mobility, and innovation-driven economic growth. Because Berkeley is emerging as a national center for AI research and commercialization, with rapidly growing clusters along the Oakland–Berkeley corridor, there is a unique opportunity to attract LPs motivated by stable returns coupled with long-term community and ecosystem-building objectives. These limited partners can provide equity capital with more flexible return expectations, longer investment horizons, and governance structures that prioritize community outcomes while still achieving market-consistent performance.
The combined financing of senior debt, sponsor equity, TOD-aligned grants, and mission-aligned LP investment, creates a capital structure that is both financially sound and strategically resonant with the site’s role in Berkeley’s future. The structure reduces risk, enhances resilience to interest-rate or cost shocks, and ensures that the project’s success is shared across stakeholders who care deeply about the long-term vitality of South Berkeley, the Ashby station area, and the broader innovation corridor.
Risk Assessment and Mitigation(Kiyan)
The project faces several categories of risk typical for transit-oriented, mixed-use development. Entitlement and permitting remain the most significant, given Berkeley’s detailed review processes, high public engagement expectations, and the site’s cultural importance linked to the Ashby Flea Market and long-standing community institutions. This risk is mitigated by aligning the project closely with the R-BMU zoning framework, BART joint-development expectations, and state-level mandates favoring higher-density, transit-oriented development. Early and continuous outreach to neighborhood groups, combined with transparent communication of project benefits, will be necessary to build trust and avoid delays.

Construction risk is present due to escalating labor and material costs and potential schedule delays. Mitigation includes selecting an experienced general contractor, using competitive bidding, applying a contingency allowance, and phasing construction to maintain cost control. Market risk is moderate given strong demand for housing near BART, UC Berkeley, and major employment centers; however, lease-up could be affected by macroeconomic conditions. This is addressed through conservative pro forma assumptions, a flexible unit mix, and a program that relies chiefly on residential demand rather than specialized commercial tenants. Operational risk is managed through professional property management, appropriate staffing, and ongoing monitoring of building performance and tenant needs.
Marketing and Lease-Up Strategy(Kiyan)
The residential lease-up strategy will position the project as modern, transit-connected living that appeals to commuters, UC Berkeley affiliates, and South Berkeley residents seeking updated housing near everyday services. Marketing will begin well before delivery, using a dedicated project website, interactive floor plans, virtual tours, and digital outreach across rental platforms, social media, and university-adjacent networks. Messaging will emphasize direct access to BART, frequent AC Transit service, and bike-friendly routes to campus, downtown, and major Oakland job centers. Early-commitment incentives such as transit credits, bike-share memberships, and resident referral programs will help accelerate absorption. Partnerships with UC Berkeley departments, nearby healthcare employers, and local organizations will broaden the tenant pool. On-site signage along Adeline Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way will reinforce project visibility. The goal is strong pre-leasing, steady absorption through opening, and rapid stabilization.
The ground-floor retail strategy focuses on filling clear neighborhood gaps to activate the site and support the residential community. The immediate area around Ashby BART offers local restaurants and small shops but lacks a high-quality convenience market, wellness or boutique fitness offerings, and flexible café or coworking space that can serve both commuters and remote workers. These uses match the daily patterns of residents, BART riders, and UC Berkeley affiliates. Target tenants include specialty grocers, health-oriented fast-casual operators, independent cafés suited for studying and hybrid work, and small-format fitness studios. By emphasizing operators that generate steady foot traffic rather than destination retail, the project strengthens the pedestrian environment, extends activity into evenings and weekends, and supports the building’s mixed-use character. A phased leasing plan with tenant improvement incentives and early-activation partnerships will help create a cohesive and functional ground floor that elevates the development’s overall appeal.
Comparable Properties Analysis (Andrew)
Analysis of recent multifamily transactions in Berkeley and the broader East Bay region provides valuable benchmarks for the Ashby BART project’s positioning and financial performance. The most relevant comparable properties include transit-oriented developments in Oakland and Berkeley, ranging from 28 to 302 units, with sale prices per unit between $281,000 and $465,000 and price per square foot ranging from $237 to $481. Notably, newer construction projects such as The Beacon in Oakland (275 units, 2022) and Aya in Fremont (302 units, 2020) achieved premium pricing at $458,000 and $465,000 per unit respectively, reflecting the market’s strong appetite for modern, transit-adjacent housing. These transactions demonstrate that properties with direct BART access or proximity to major transit nodes command pricing at the upper end of the range, with vacancy rates consistently below 10% and often approaching zero in prime locations. The Ashby BART site’s unique combination of direct station adjacency, UC Berkeley proximity, and 4.4-acre scale positions it to achieve pricing at or above the premium end of these comparables, while the project’s larger unit count and integrated mixed-use program create operational efficiencies and additional revenue streams not captured in the residential-only comp set. The comparable sales validate the project’s fundamental market assumptions regarding demand strength, rent growth potential, and the enduring value premium associated with transit-oriented, academically adjacent development in the East Bay.
