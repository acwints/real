FORMULAS REFERENCE - For Google Sheets Implementation

CORE FORMULAS
Metric	Formula	Example
Land SF	Acres * 43560	13*43560 = 566,280 SF
Building SF	Land SF * Site Coverage %	566280*0.25 = 141,570 SF (Option 2)
Total Dev Cost	Acquisition + Construction Costs	15000000+42471000 = $57,471,000
Construction Cost	Building SF * Cost per SF	141570*300 = $42,471,000
NOI	Effective Gross Income - Operating Expenses	(Rent*SF)*(1-Vacancy%) - (OpEx*SF)
Return on Cost	NOI / Total Development Cost	4671810/57471000 = 8.13%
Stabilized Value	NOI / Cap Rate	4671810/0.0575 = $81,249,043
Profit	Stabilized Value - Total Development Cost	81249043-57471000 = $23,778,043
Profit Margin	Profit / Total Development Cost	23778043/57471000 = 41.38%
Development Spread	(Return on Cost - Cap Rate) * 10000	(0.0813-0.0575)*10000 = 238 bps

INDUSTRIAL GROSS LEASE (Option 1)
Description	Formula
Gross Rent	Given: $7.50/SF
Operating Expenses	Given: $2.25/SF (landlord pays, non-reimbursable)
Net Effective Rent	Gross Rent - Operating Expenses = $7.50 - $2.25 = $5.25/SF
Vacancy Deduction	Gross Rent * Vacancy % = $7.50 * 5% = $0.375/SF
NOI per SF	Net Effective Rent * (1 - Vacancy%) = $5.25 * 0.95 = $4.99/SF
NOI Total	NOI per SF * Building SF = $4.99 * 280,000 = $1,365,000

NNN LEASE (Option 2 - Walmart)
Description	Formula
Base Rent (NNN)	Given: $33.00/SF
Operating Expenses	Given: $10.00/SF (passed through to tenant)
Effective Gross Income	Base Rent + OpEx Reimbursement = $33 + $10 = $43/SF
Less: Operating Expenses	$10.00/SF
NOI	$33.00/SF (equals base rent in NNN)
Vacancy	0% (single tenant, credit lease)
NOI Total	$33.00 * 141,570 = $4,671,810

BUILD-TO-SUIT RENT CALC (Option 3)
Description	Formula
Total Development Cost	$108,436,200
Required Return on Cost	14% (given - tenant will pay this)
Required NOI	Total Dev Cost * Required ROC = $108,436,200 * 0.14 = $15,181,068
Building SF	169,884
Required Rent per SF	Required NOI / Building SF = $15,181,068 / 169,884 = $89.36/SF

RENT BUMP CALCULATIONS (Option 2)
Year Range	Formula	Result
Years 1-5	Base Rent	$33.00/SF
Years 6-10	Base * (1 + Bump%)	$33.00 * 1.05 = $34.65/SF
Years 11-15	Year 6 Rent * (1 + Bump%)	$34.65 * 1.05 = $36.38/SF

TIME VALUE ADJUSTMENTS (Optional Advanced)
Description	Formula	Notes
NPV of Cash Flows	NPV(discount_rate, cash_flow_range)	Use for comparing options with different timelines
IRR	IRR(cash_flow_range)	Include acquisition as negative, sale as positive
Holding Period Return	(Sale Price - Purchase Price + NOI) / Purchase Price	Simple return over hold period

SENSITIVITY TABLE SETUP
To create sensitivity tables in Google Sheets:
1. Set up a data table with cap rates in column A
2. In cell B1, reference your Stabilized Value formula
3. Select the range including headers and data
4. Go to Data then Data Table (or use manual formulas)
5. For Cap Rate sensitivity: NOI/A2 (where A2 is the cap rate)

KEY ASSUMPTIONS TO MAKE EDITABLE
Create an Inputs section with these cells that feed into formulas:
Input Cell	Description	Option 1	Option 2	Option 3
Acquisition Price	Purchase price	15000000	15000000	15000000
Land Acres	Site size	13	13	13
Site Coverage %	Building footprint ratio	N/A	25%	30%
Construction $/SF	All-in hard and soft	8.93	300	550
Rent $/SF	Stabilized rent	7.50	33.00	89.36
Operating Expenses $/SF	Annual OpEx	2.25	10.00	15.00
Vacancy %	Assumed vacancy	5%	0%	0%
Exit Cap Rate	Sale cap rate	7.25%	5.75%	8.00%
Contingency %	Budget contingency	10%	5%	5%

GOOGLE SHEETS TIPS
Tip	Description
Named Ranges	Create named ranges for key inputs (e.g., AcquisitionPrice, CapRate) for easier formula reading
Conditional Formatting	Highlight negative values in red, positive in green
Data Validation	Add dropdowns for scenario selection
Sparklines	Add mini charts to show sensitivity ranges
INDIRECT function	Use INDIRECT("Option"&A1&"!B5") to reference cells across sheets dynamically
