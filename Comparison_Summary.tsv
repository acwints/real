POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES SUMMARY

OPTION 1: INDUSTRIAL REPOSITIONING
Positives	Negatives
Lowest capital ($17.75M)	Lowest absolute returns
Fastest execution (24 months)	Limited upside potential
No entitlement risk	City discouraging industrial
Proven market (5% vacancy)	35-year-old building
Leaseback income during renovation	Commodity product
Lowest risk profile	Competes on price only
Highest risk-adjusted IRR (~8%)

OPTION 2: WALMART BIG BOX
Positives	Negatives
AA tenant credit	High entitlement risk
15-year NNN lease	4.25 year timeline (best case)
5% rent bumps	Community opposition
City wants retail	Could be delayed indefinitely
41% profit margin	$57M capital requirement
HDP has big box experience	Single-purpose building
Negative risk-adjusted IRR (-7%)

OPTION 3: MOBILE ONE R&D
Positives	Negatives
Highest paper returns (15% IRR)	Startup tenant (no product)
City supports tech	99% premium to market rent
Easier entitlements	$108M capital requirement
14% return on cost	HDP has no R&D experience
Build-to-suit premium	10-year lease only
12% market vacancy
Only 25-30% chance tenant survives
Risk-adjusted IRR only 6.3%

RECOMMENDATION
Rank	Option	IRR (Base)	IRR (Risk-Adj)	Rationale
1	OPTION 1	8.2%	~8%	Best risk-adjusted return; fastest execution; preserve capital
2	OPTION 2	10.8%	-7%	Only with strong political ties and extended timeline contingency
3	OPTION 3	15.1%	6%	Paper returns attractive but tenant survival unlikely; avoid

FINAL RECOMMENDATION: OPTION 1

Key Reasons:
1. Risk-adjusted returns are highest when accounting for probability of success
2. 24-month execution vs 42-51 months preserves optionality
3. $17.75M capital requirement vs $57-108M reduces firm risk
4. Leaseback provides income during renovation
5. Option value: can pursue redevelopment later if market conditions improve
6. HDP builds track record for future opportunities

Mitigations if Pursuing Other Options:
Option 2 - Negotiate Walmart extension options; build political coalition early; budget for 3+ year entitlement
Option 3 - Require large security deposit; personal guarantees; rent tied to funding milestones; termination rights
